Last Minute Notes
-----------------
New file extensions are not shown in open dialog box when set 
to 'Supported Audio Files / Archives'.
This is a microsoft bug/issue: open dialog extensions are limited to a total of 
259 characters (MAXPATH = 260 - 1 (\n)).
Solution: Set files of type to 'All files' / use drag & drop.

Last Minute Notes
-----------------
I have disabled xbox iso support in this version due to it's poor stability.
I recommend using another program until it's re-enabled.


Hybrid Mode
-----------
Hybrid Mode means that files are scanned automatically with Scx 
(If deemed nessesary).
-Exact specs-
Filesize is read from file, if it matches with actual filesize it gets loaded.
If it doesn't match, file is first Auto-Scanned 
with Scx, all found files are then loaded as normal.
If it's a format like Xbp the file will be scanned without a filesize check.


Dat/DatRoller Notes
-------------------
There seems to be only one audio container format - css1.dat.
Most of the other dats are xbadpcm's with a dat extension.
Both types are supported.


Pak Notes
---------
Pak files only work if pertaining 'Sonica.XB' file exists in the same directory 
or in '..\\scripts' directory, as this file contains the offsets/filenames etc..
You can of course use Scx as it will find & extract the files perfectly, 
however you will miss out on having meaningful filenames.


Stx Notes
---------
Loop point clicks are no longer an issue as I figured out exactly
how the looping is done.
-No hack type code was used.


Stx FileSwap
------------
Input files must be in Xbox Adpcm format (Mono/Stereo, Standard sample rates).
For looping files (e.g. Music) loop points are automatically set 
@ the start & end points.
If you have a file with a fade at the start & end it should loop nicely.
Looping a drumloop doesn't work as well yet. 

(Update: I now know how to fix this, too busy to get it done at the moment)


Xwb FileSwap
------------
Sxb/Vxb formats (Ford Racing 3) should now also be filwswap compatible.
I've tested xwb's from over 40 different games with the improved code, 
Compatibility on standard Version 2 & 3 Xwb's is now approx 85%.
Compatibility on standard Version 1 Xwb's is approx 70%.


Kakuto Chojin Notes
-------------------
It seems that the reason that this game was recalled was due to the 'Asad' 
Hall Of Fates stage music containing Holy Qur'an chants.
The original US versions are supposedly the only ones which contained these chants.
The Xct entries included are for the original Ntsc-U (Qur'an chant) version.


SCX Notes
---------
Before SCX calculated the filesizes like this:

file x filesize = file x offset + next file offset

I used this hack method because it generally worked fine in real world scenarios 
& because it was fast.
However if there was a single small wav at the very beginning of a large file
the extracted wav would be as large as the whole file from which it was extracted.
Due to the code changes, this should no longer be a problem.


SCX Format Tests
----------------
I carried out tests on: 
Pcm, IMA Adpcm, MS Adpcm, Xbox Adpcm, Wma, Xwb (ver 2&3)

- All were handled perfectly.
(i.e all filesizes were correct, no files were missed etc.)


SCX Speed Comparisons
---------------------
Game System: Xbox
Game: Burnout 3: Takedown
File: _EATrax0.xwb
Filesize: 82.4MB
Contains: 22 Wma's


HyperRipper - Dragon UnPACKer v5.2.0b "Cinthia"
-----------------------------------------------
Settings- BufferMemory: 8192bytes, Rollback: 128bytes, Formats: Ogg, Wav
Scanning Time: 407.7sec


Jaeder Naub V1.9.0t
-------------------
Settings- Formats: Ogg, Wav
Scanning Time: >40min


SCX - EkszBox-ABX v1.6
----------------------
Settings- Buffer Size: Medium, Tidy Names: On
Scanning Time: 5sec


Scx Formats
-----------
The test/debug version of EkszBox-ABX has support for 18 formats:
Adx, Flac, Ogg, Mp3, Mpc, Wav, Wma, Xwb, 
3ds, Adp (Gamecube), Bmp, Dds, Lwo, Pcx, Png, Thp (Gamecube), X & Xbg.
There is no attempt to read/calc the filesizes on any of these yet.
When i'm putting the finishing touches to SCX I may add support 
for some of these in the release version (if I figure out how to 
get the exact filesizes).




V1.5 Changes
============

* 28 formats supported.
* Exclusive Hwx support (Star Wars Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith).
* Exclusive Lug support (Fable).
* Exclusive Samp support (Namco Museum 50th Anniversary).

* Added 'Cancel Batch' button; Cancels batch mode file extraction.
* X360 Xwb header info is now byteswapped in assembly as opposed to C++ (50% faster).
* Scx could miss very small files at the end of archives- fixed.
* The following extensions are now supported: 
  .pak - (OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast) & .dvdxwb/.hdxwb - (MechAssault 2)
  as pertaining files are standard Xwb's.

i.e 'Fountain.lug' needs 'Fountain.met' etc.........


Samp Notes
----------
Samp files only work if pertaining uber files exist in the same directory.
i.e 'Namco50.samp' needs 'Namco50.uber' etc.........


Xbox Iso Notes
--------------
Tested & confirmed to work with iso's made using qwix & xboxisotool.
Contained directories are not created, 
there may be an option in the future to support this.
If you don't have alot of free Ram you may have issues extracting large files.


Documention Info
----------------
Docs have not been fully updated since last version due to lack of time/interest.



^ Thanks to TeknoJuce for the MechAssault 2 extension info.




V1.4 Changes

* Added a bits option (Only works for Pcm audio).
* Removed bits of extraneous code from a few places.
* Changed/fixed many other bits & pieces.
* Added Xct database entries for Kakuto Chojin.



Stx Notes
---------
Stx is a modified xadpcm/abadpcm format.

It's the first audio format i've managed to crack.

Compatibility is greater than 90%.
A few stage stream files have 4 channels they won't
play/convert with any programs I know of.

Files are converted into standard xadpcm format, regardless of program settings.

Gaps/clicks are indicative of loop points as opposed to conversion errors.




V1.3 Changes

* SCX support for xwb's.
* SCX buffer code rewritten.
* Pcm & Xadpcm headers are written faster due to code optimization.

* settings.ini renamed to EkszBoxSettings.ini.
* Added Xct database entries for 'Soul Calibur II' & 'Psyvariar 2 Extend Edition'.



Halo Map Notes
--------------
Decompressed maps are saved as *.mapU, these are safe to delete after you're done
extracting. To save time they may also be loaded directly.



Msx Notes
---------
Some extracted files don't work, due to a lack of time/Msx files I was unable to do 
anything about this. 
(I might try to fix the problem for the next version [if there is one]).




V1.2 Changes
============

* 17 formats are now supported.
* Adx support (Always extracts to Pcm format).
* Sxb/Vxb support ('Ford Racing 3').

* Fixed San Andreas Xct database entries.
* Added Xct database entries for Burnout Revenge, Madagascar & Mojo!.



-> Source code (C++Builder 2006) will be included in one of the next versions.



Rcf Audio File Swap Notes
-------------------------
* Imported audio must be in pcm format (16bit, stereo or mono).

* Tetris Worlds: Music can easily be swapped
  (Must be stereo & 24khz to play at correct speed) 

* Simpsons Hit & Run: Car sounds can be changed, however there will be freeze-ups 
  if imported files don't have very similiar specs compared to the originals.
  Music is a pain to swap as the game seems very fussy about certain files 
  (Possibly the rms files contained in 'music01' have region &/or filesize info which 
  needs to be changed to fix this).



Improved/Fixed Rcf support Notes
--------------------------------
Note: Offsets & pertaining chunk sizes are now sorted by size to match with filenames.
Pcm files as found in Simpsons Hit & Run now have all the padding removed from start, 
(This padding caused clicks at the beginning of sounds).




V1.1 Changes
============

* New Xwb audio file swap feature: xadpcm, pcm & wma files contained in xwb's may 
  now be swapped with your own.
* Interestingly, with some games this feature even allows you to use xadpcm in place
  of pcm or pcm in place of xadpcm etc.. (Most of the time swapping wma for
  xadpcm/pcm or vice versa won't work).
  Note: For best compatibility only use audio files which are all in pcm, xadpcm or wma
  format & if your game crashes try to match the specs of the original sounds more 
  closely. 
  Mixing & matching different formats within banks can cause problems with many games.
* This feature was only made possible because I finally managed to crack the pcm 
  magic numbers formula as well as the critical xwb file padding algorithm.
* Supports most streaming or in-memory version 1, 2 & 3 xwb's. 
  (Many ver 1 xwb's should work, 
  albeit maybe not always as perfectly as most ver. 2 or 3 xbe's do).
* Tested & confirmed to work with xwb's from Burnout 3, Capcom Classics Collection,
  Egg Mania, PGR2, Sims 2, Super Bubble Pop & Top Spin.
  (Had a load of fun swapping sounds & music from Street Fighter 2 in Capcom Classics
  as well as changing engine sounds in PGR2).
* Xwb Pcm info contained in magic numbers is now decoded with my own formula. 
  (much faster & more elegant than previous solution)
* Updated Sims 2 filename database entry.
* Removed: Rws debug info.
* Removed: Browse for folder support. (Temporary - when I get it working perfectly it 
  will be added again)
* Fixed: Wav headers were not being created for audio files extracted from Rfa's.
* Fixed: Auto-Clear CheckBox caption was static.
* Cleaned up some more bits of code.



Xwb Audio File Swap Instructions
--------------------------------
(1) Open an xwb.
(2) Make sure the file list is enabled.
(3) Check or uncheck appropriate files in the file list.
(4) Right click the file list & click on 'swap checked'.
(5) Figure out the rest on your own.

Note: If you click cancel on the open file dialog after having clicked 'swap checked' 
the original audio file from the opened xwb will be inserted in place of the file you 
were supposed to select.
Note: Edited Xwb's put in a folder named (FileSwap).




V1.01 Changes
=============

* New (tentative) support for Zwb (Thanks to Luigi Auriemma for the info)
* Fixed a bug which caused extracted filenames to be messed up.
* Removed debug & partially supported formats code.
* Cleaned up a few small bits of code & fixed a few other minor bugs.

Info
====


SCX
---
SCX Buffer sizes are now allocated based on available (non-virtual) memory.
Scanning multi GB files should be possible on any system now.
If you're scanning large files choosing a large buffer may not be a good idea.
Medium is not any slower alot of the time.


Xct
---
The Xct format was designed with simplicity & speed in mind (More speed optimizations 
are on the way).
Switching the Xct database off will not give much of a performance gain as scanning 
it for a match takes on average less than 0.01 secs.


Rws Format
----------
The first file in every Max Payne 2 rws is blank.
This is not an error with the way this app parses these files.


Operating System
----------------
Windows 9x users who wish to run the app using a shortcut need to follow these steps
to avoid anomalies:

* Make your shortcut
* Right click the shortcut
* Select properties
* Copy all of the text from the 'Target' textbox to the 'Start in' textbox
* Remove EkszBox-ABX v***.exe from the text you copied into the 'Start in' textbox 
  (Don't remove the " from the end)



Misc
----
To play xadpcm, xwb, zwb, wba, xsd or xsh files with winamp try 
this Xbox ADPCM plugin:

Help
====

Let's say you had 700 xwb's and you didn't want the contents of each put into a 
subfolder, you just wanted all audio files dumped into a single folder, well this 
can actually be done 
like this:

(1) Turn the List off [This is optional, but will offer better speed].
(2) Turn the Xct database off (Also optional).
(3) Turn Auto-Clear off.
(4) Enter a name into the Folder name textbox.
(5) Click Open or SCX & select all the files you wish to batch process.


Format, Channels & Sample Rate settings generally only change what info is written to 
the pcm or xadpcm headers.
These settings should set to Auto for most situations, however for converting adx files
contained in afs files into pcm format, the Format setting should be changed to PCM.
